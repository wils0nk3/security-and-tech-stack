# 💻 security-and-tech-stack

**Core documentation for the secure architecture, comprehensive governance standards, and modern technology stack used across various high-integrity applications.**

This repository publicly outlines the deep security methodologies and technical principles employed in my work. It assures sponsors and collaborators of a commitment to industry-leading standards for system integrity and data protection, leveraging expertise from IT fundamentals to advanced data forensics.

## I. 🛡️ Security & Governance Philosophy (Management Level)

This section highlights the strategic and managerial principles that guide the architecture of all projects, reflecting expertise in **Cybersecurity Management** and **Risk Governance**.

| Domain | Strategy & Documentation Focus | Value to Projects |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Comprehensive Risk Management** | **Holistic Threat Modeling:** Documentation of methodologies used to assess and mitigate risks across all system layers (client, network, cloud, human). | Ensures proactive security planning and reduces systemic exposure. |
| **Zero Trust Architecture** | **Authentication & Authorization Model:** Design principles requiring explicit verification for all access, regardless of location (internal or external). | Minimizes insider threat and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive systems. |
| **System Lifecycle Management** | **Vulnerability & Patch Policy:** Standards for continuous monitoring, dependency scanning, and managing security debt throughout a project's entire lifecycle. | Maintains long-term system integrity and resilience against emerging threats. |

## II. 🧩 Core Technology Stack & Implementation

This publicly declares the proficiency in the foundational and specialized technologies used for developing secure, robust, and scalable applications.

* **Development Core:** **React Native, TypeScript, and Python** for robust, cross-platform application development and secure back-end processing.
* **Data Integrity & Forensics:** **SQL** expertise (including **T-SQL/PL-SQL** standards) for managing complex, relational data structures and ensuring forensic-grade data integrity and analysis.
* **Infrastructure & Deployment:** **Virtualization, Networking fundamentals, and Containerization (Docker)** for creating isolated, reproducible, and highly secure deployment environments ($\text{CompTIA A+}$ and operational proficiency).
* **Digital Evidence Protection:** Protocols for embedding **cryptographic methods** and **secure mobile storage** to protect sensitive data at the point of capture.

## III. 🔑 Data & Application Protection Standards

This addresses the critical security controls vital for any application that handles sensitive or high-integrity data.

* **Advanced Encryption:** Commitment to using **AES-256** encryption for data at rest and **TLS/SSL** with perfect forward secrecy for data in transit.
* **Application Security:** Adherence to mandatory security checklists and code review principles based on guidelines like the **OWASP** Top 10 to prevent common vulnerabilities.
* **Data Access Controls:** Implementation of least-privilege principles and strong audit trails to manage and log all access to sensitive data stores (a key function of $\text{MCSE}$ data governance).
Now that all your public content is finalized, the next critical step for a Cybersecurity Administrator is to secure your private development environment.

Would you like to proceed with generating the initial **Security Audit Checklist** for the private repositories of the **Rules of Conduct Civil Rights App**?
